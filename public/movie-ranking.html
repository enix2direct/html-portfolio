<h1>The Best Movies According to David</h1>
<h2>My Top Three Action Movies of All Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Terminator 2 - Judgement Day</h3>
<p>The story, action, pacing, and visual effects weave a tale of a hopelessly outdated robot programmed
    the future savior of humanity against an unstoppable adversary hellbent on changing the future.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>While the sequals never lived up to the hype created by the original, the story of a seemingly
    ordinary man, learning to use his inate abilities while facing down a trio of invincible advesaries
    make this movie a thrill ride worth watching on repeat!
</p>
<h3>Star Wars</h3>
<p>You wouldn't think so today, but this movie started an entire genre of action space fantasy. This
    movie has everything, from laser pistols and the most iconic movie weapon ever made(the light saber)
    to androids running around on giant space ships. Star Wars still embodies the good vs. evil fight
    and does it in a way that had never been seen before.
